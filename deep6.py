# binary classifiaction of sonar returns
# to start, good to use same amount of first hidden layer nr of neurons as nr of input variables
# data preparation with standardization, data rescaled, use sklearn
# use pipeline to streamline things...
# tune layers and neurons in the model for better model performance
# tune zb weight initialization, activation fkt, optimization procedure, network topology etc
# make network topology smaller (a lot of redundancy in input variables),
# type of feature extraction by restricting representational spce in first hidden layer
# make network topology larger ( more opportunity for network to extract key features), add
# a new layer to network. network is given opportunity to model all input variables before being
# bottlenecked and forces to halve representational capacity. adds additional hidden layer that
# aides the process

# Project: Regression Of Boston House Prices
# input attributes vary in scale, standardize data before using in model (after using model w unstandardized data...)
# standardize w pipeline to avoid data leakage during folding of cross-validation
# try improve network by adding new layers or be increasing or decreasing neurons in layers
# trial and error
